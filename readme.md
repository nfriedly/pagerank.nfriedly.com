Google PageRank Lookup Tool
===========================

A simple tool to report the PageRank of a given site. Try an example at 
http://pagerank.nfriedly.com or host your own. Plays nicely with most node.js 0.8+ 
environments, including heroku.

Todo:
-----

* Change bookmarklet to a popup window so that it can store the results in localStorage
* Sort results by date, newest first
* Add option to delete a result from the list (and storage)
* Add support for multiple values at different dates
* Add in server-side caching
* Add in server-side rate-limiting
